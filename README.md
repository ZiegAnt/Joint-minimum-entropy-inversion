# Joint-minimum-entropy-inversion
Repository containing additional figures for the poster og GeoFest 2023

**Note:** 'ME' refers to 'standalone minimum entropy', 'MEG' indicates 'minimum entropy gradient' and 'J' indicates the joint approach in the abbreviations.

The folders contain following Figures:
- Parameter_Tests: Figures that show tests of regularization parameter $\lambda$ and smoothing factor $a$ for standalone ERT and SRT inversions for first and second-order.
- Result_Comparison: Figures that show a comparison of conventional smoothness-constrained inversion, standalone inversion with entropy constraints and joint inversion results
- Synth_Data: Figures displaying synthetic models and data
